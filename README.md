# AI Combat #

We are the AI@UCLA Gaming Group.

AI Combat is a top-down shooter in which programmable AI bots battle each other
in a closed arena. We're doing this in Python using the PyGame library to write
the engine and game logic.

**Goals**

- To become familiar with Python and the PyGame API
- Dive into game development
- Apply AI concepts to game dev
- Gain knowledge of general software development tools

# Development #

Our project is still in its very early stages! Stay tuned for more progress
over the upcoming months.

# Running #

To run AI Combat simply execute:

    python AICombat/AICombat.py

# Dependencies #

AI Combat uses Python 2.7 and relies on the pygame library for windowing and
painting.
